Python Lab Experiments .py files with screenshots of source codes and outputs

Experiment 5: Given a list of number,stop processing input after the cumulative sum becomes negative.

Experiment 6: Given an array S of size N , check if it is possible to split sequence into two sequences -
s1 to si and si+1 to sN such that first sequence is strictly decreasing and second is strictly increasing. Print true/false as output.

Experiment 7: Given a non negative integer A, print all the pairs of integers(a,b) such that
a and b are positive integers
a<=b and
a^2 + b^2 = A
0 <= A
A<=1000

Experiment 8: Write a Python program to demonstrate working of classes and
objects with example. Example will be the ATM machine
As we know ATM machine performs multiple operations and those are:
1.Account Information
2.PIN Change
3.Balance Inquiry
4.Withdrawal
5. Deposit

Experiment 9: Your task is to generate all prime numbers between two given numbers!
